<b>Lyrae • Physically-based Real-Time Path Traced Shaderpack</b>
</p>

## Features
- **Real-Time Voxel Path Tracing**
  - Monte Carlo global illumination with multiple light bounces
  - Fast voxel traversal via DDA algorithm

- **Sampling & Image Stability**
  - Temporal accumulation with reprojection for noise reduction
  - Next Event Estimation (NEE) for explicit sun sampling
  - Edge avoiding À-Trous denoiser

- **Physically-Based Materials**
  - Unified physically-based shading pipeline
  - Designed for real-time & artistic efficiency
  - Support for labPBR resource packs

- **Post-Processing**
  - Filmic tonemapping
  - Color grading
  - Chromatic aberration

📌 **NOTICE:** This project is currently in _very early_ alpha stages. Expect issues, visual artifacts and varying performance. I have a huge roadmap. I'd appreciate any kind of feedback and your support!
